The only way I found to clear the error -
"botocore.exceptions.ClientError:
An error occurred (InvalidClientTokenId) when calling the CreateRole
operation: The security token included in the request is invalid" is to use export in the CLI as below and entering the access key and secret access key.


mathewos-viti:~/environment $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxx
mathewos-viti:~/environment $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyyy



To create the zip file for handler.py from CLI

mathewos-viti:~/environment/lambda_function $ zip lambda.zip handler.py
